# Monitoring and Observability Labs

This module covers monitoring, logging, and observability using CloudWatch, X-Ray, and AWS Config. These labs will help you prepare for the AWS DevOps Professional certification by providing hands-on experience with AWS monitoring services.

## Labs Available

- **cloudwatch**: Comprehensive monitoring with custom metrics, dashboards, alarms, and log aggregation
- **xray**: Distributed tracing for microservices applications
- **config**: Compliance monitoring and automated remediation

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Python 3.6+ with boto3 library installed
- Applications to monitor (can use provided samples)
- Basic understanding of monitoring concepts

## Lab Structure

Each lab follows a consistent structure:

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: CloudFormation templates for resource provisioning
2. **Automated Setup**: Scripts for quick lab deployment
3. **Guided Exercises**: Step-by-step instructions with explanations
4. **Advanced Topics**: Additional challenges for deeper learning
5. **Cleanup Instructions**: Procedures to remove resources and avoid charges

## Certification Relevance

These labs cover key monitoring topics from the AWS DevOps Professional exam:

- Setting up comprehensive monitoring solutions
- Implementing automated alerting and incident response
- Creating centralized logging architectures
- Configuring compliance monitoring and remediation
- Integrating monitoring into CI/CD pipelines

## Estimated Costs

- **CloudWatch**: $0.30/metric/month, $0.10/alarm/month, $3.00/dashboard/month
- **X-Ray**: $5.00/million traces recorded, $0.50/million traces retrieved
- **Config**: $0.003/configuration item recorded, $0.001/configuration item recorded for conformance packs

> **Note**: Most resources in these labs are eligible for the AWS Free Tier, but some advanced features like CloudWatch dashboards are not. Always clean up resources after completing labs to minimize costs.
