```

### Resources Created:
- **Parent CloudFormation Stack**: Orchestrates the deployment of nested stacks
- **Network Stack**: VPC, public and private subnets, route tables, internet gateway
- **Security Stack**: Security groups for web and application tiers
- **Application Stack**: EC2 instances, load balancer, auto scaling group
- **S3 Bucket**: For storing nested stack templates
- **Lambda Function**: Custom resource for generating secure passwords
- **IAM Roles**: Service roles for Lambda and EC2 instances

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Understand the CloudFormation Templates

1. **Review the parent stack template:**
   ```bash
   # View the parent stack template
   cat templates/parent-stack.yaml
   ```
   
   - Note how the parent stack references nested stacks
   - Observe the parameters passed between stacks
   - Examine the custom resource implementation

2. **Review the nested stack templates:**
   ```bash
   # View the network stack template
   cat templates/network-stack.yaml
   
   # View the security stack template
   cat templates/security-stack.yaml
   
   # View the application stack template
   cat templates/application-stack.yaml
   ```
   
   - Understand how each stack exports values for other stacks to use
   - Note the dependencies between stacks
   - Observe the resource organization by function

3. **Review the stack set template:**
   ```bash
   # View the stack set template for multi-region deployment
   cat templates/stackset-template.yaml
   ```
   
   - Understand how stack sets enable multi-region and multi-account deployments

### Step 2: Deploy the Nested Stacks

1. **Run the provisioning script:**
   ```bash
   # On Linux/Mac:
   ./scripts/provision-nested-stacks.sh
   
   # On Windows:
   bash scripts/provision-nested-stacks.sh
   ```
   
   > **Note**: This script will create AWS resources in your account. Make sure you have the necessary permissions.

2. **Monitor the deployment process:**
   - The script creates an S3 bucket and uploads the nested templates
   - CloudFormation deploys the parent stack, which then deploys the nested stacks
   - The deployment takes approximately 10-15 minutes to complete
   
   ```bash
   # Check the status of the parent stack
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name devops-lab-nested --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus'
   ```
   
   Expected output when complete:
   ```
   "CREATE_COMPLETE"
   ```

3. **Examine the deployed resources:**
   ```bash
   # List all resources in the parent stack
   aws cloudformation list-stack-resources --stack-name devops-lab-nested
   
   # View the outputs from the parent stack
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name devops-lab-nested --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs'
   ```
   
   - Note the physical IDs of the nested stacks
   - Observe the outputs exported from each stack
   - See how the parent stack aggregates outputs from nested stacks

### Step 3: Explore Change Sets

1. **Create a change set:**
   ```bash
   # Create a change set to modify the VPC CIDR
   CHANGE_SET_NAME="vpc-cidr-change-$(date +%s)"
   
   aws cloudformation create-change-set \
     --stack-name devops-lab-nested \
     --change-set-name $CHANGE_SET_NAME \
     --template-body file://templates/parent-stack.yaml \
     --parameters \
       ParameterKey=Environment,UsePreviousValue=true \
       ParameterKey=VpcCidr,ParameterValue="10.1.0.0/16" \
       ParameterKey=KeyPairName,UsePreviousValue=true \
     --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
   ```

2. **Review the change set:**
   ```bash
   # Wait for change set creation to complete
   aws cloudformation wait change-set-create-complete \
     --stack-name devops-lab-nested \
     --change-set-name $CHANGE_SET_NAME
   
   # View the changes that would be made
   aws cloudformation describe-change-set \
     --stack-name devops-lab-nested \
     --change-set-name $CHANGE_SET_NAME
   ```
   
   - Observe which resources would be modified, replaced, or deleted
   - Note the replacement patterns for network resources

3. **Execute or delete the change set:**
   ```bash
   # To execute the change set:
   aws cloudformation execute-change-set \
     --stack-name devops-lab-nested \
     --change-set-name $CHANGE_SET_NAME
   
   # OR to delete the change set without executing:
   aws cloudformation delete-change-set \
     --stack-name devops-lab-nested \
     --change-set-name $CHANGE_SET_NAME
   ```
   
   > **Note**: Executing the change set will modify your infrastructure. For this lab, you can delete the change set without executing it.

### Step 4: Detect and Manage Configuration Drift

1. **Initiate drift detection:**
   ```bash
   # Start drift detection on the parent stack
   DRIFT_ID=$(aws cloudformation detect-stack-drift \
     --stack-name devops-lab-nested \
     --query 'StackDriftDetectionId' \
     --output text)
   
   echo "Drift detection initiated with ID: $DRIFT_ID"
   ```

2. **Check drift detection status:**
   ```bash
   # Wait for drift detection to complete
   aws cloudformation wait stack-drift-detection-complete \
     --stack-drift-detection-id $DRIFT_ID
   
   # View the drift detection results
   aws cloudformation describe-stack-drift-detection-status \
     --stack-drift-detection-id $DRIFT_ID
   ```
   
   Expected output if no drift:
   ```
   "StackDriftStatus": "IN_SYNC"
   ```

3. **Manually modify a resource to create drift:**
   ```bash
   # Get the security group ID from the security stack
   SG_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stack-resources \
     --stack-name $(aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource \
       --stack-name devops-lab-nested \
       --logical-resource-id SecurityStack \
       --query 'StackResourceDetail.PhysicalResourceId' \
       --output text) \
     --logical-resource-id WebSecurityGroup \
     --query 'StackResources[0].PhysicalResourceId' \
     --output text)
   
   # Add a new ingress rule to create drift
   aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
     --group-id $SG_ID \
     --protocol tcp \
     --port 8080 \
     --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
   
   echo "Added new rule to security group $SG_ID to demonstrate drift"
   ```

4. **Re-run drift detection and view drifted resources:**
   ```bash
   # Start new drift detection
   DRIFT_ID=$(aws cloudformation detect-stack-drift \
     --stack-name devops-lab-nested \
     --query 'StackDriftDetectionId' \
     --output text)
   
   # Wait for drift detection to complete
   aws cloudformation wait stack-drift-detection-complete \
     --stack-drift-detection-id $DRIFT_ID
   
   # View the drift detection results
   aws cloudformation describe-stack-drift-detection-status \
     --stack-drift-detection-id $DRIFT_ID
   
   # View drifted resources
   aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource-drifts \
     --stack-name devops-lab-nested \
     --stack-resource-drift-status-filters MODIFIED DELETED
   ```
   
   - Note which resources have drifted from their expected configuration
   - Observe the differences between current and expected property values

5. **Remediate drift by updating the stack:**
   ```bash
   # Update the stack to match the template again (remediate drift)
   aws cloudformation update-stack \
     --stack-name devops-lab-nested \
     --use-previous-template \
     --parameters \
       ParameterKey=Environment,UsePreviousValue=true \
       ParameterKey=VpcCidr,UsePreviousValue=true \
       ParameterKey=KeyPairName,UsePreviousValue=true \
     --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
   
   # Wait for update to complete
   aws cloudformation wait stack-update-complete \
     --stack-name devops-lab-nested
   ```
   
   - This will revert the manually added security group rule
   - The stack will return to its defined state in the template

### Step 5: Explore Stack Sets (Optional)

1. **Review the stack set template:**
   ```bash
   # View the stack set template
   cat templates/stackset-template.yaml
   ```
   
   - Note how the template is designed for multi-region deployment
   - Observe the parameters that allow customization per region

2. **Create and manage stack sets:**
   ```bash
   # Run the stack set management script
   ./scripts/manage-stacksets.sh
   ```
   
   - Follow the prompts to create a stack set
   - Observe how instances are created in multiple regions
   - Note the permissions required for stack set operations

## Troubleshooting Guide



### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Nested stack creation failure:**
   - **Issue**: One or more nested stacks fail during creation, causing the parent stack to fail.
   - **Solutions**:
     - Check the events for the specific nested stack that failed using `aws cloudformation describe-stack-events`
     - Look for dependency issues between resources (resources being referenced before creation)
     - Verify that exported values are correctly referenced with the proper `Fn::ImportValue` syntax
     - Check IAM permissions for creating all required resources across services
     - Examine resource quotas that might be exceeded (e.g., VPC limits, security group rules)
     - Check for naming conflicts with existing resources
     - Verify that parameter values passed to nested stacks are valid and of the correct type
     - Look for timing issues where resources might not be fully created before being referenced

2. **Change set creation failures:**
   - **Issue**: Change sets fail to create or cannot be executed.
   - **Solutions**:
     - Verify template syntax is correct using `aws cloudformation validate-template`
     - Check that parameter values are valid and within allowed ranges
     - Ensure IAM permissions allow change set operations (CreateChangeSet, ExecuteChangeSet)
     - Look for circular dependencies in resource updates
     - Check for resources that cannot be updated (require replacement)
     - Verify that the stack is in a valid state for updates (not ROLLBACK_COMPLETE)
     - Check for resources that have been modified outside of CloudFormation
     - Ensure the change set doesn't exceed the maximum number of resources (200 per change set)

3. **Drift detection issues:**
   - **Issue**: Drift detection fails or reports incorrect results.
   - **Solutions**:
     - Ensure IAM permissions allow drift detection operations
     - Check that all resources in the stack support drift detection (not all resource types do)
     - For nested stacks, detect drift on individual stacks if parent drift detection fails
     - Verify that the stack is in a stable state (CREATE_COMPLETE, UPDATE_COMPLETE)
     - Check for resources that might have been modified by automated processes
     - Be aware of resource properties that CloudFormation doesn't track for drift
     - Use resource-specific commands to verify actual configuration
     - For large stacks, break drift detection into smaller operations

4. **Stack deletion failures:**
   - **Issue**: Stack deletion fails, leaving resources in a potentially costly state.
   - **Solutions**:
     - Look for resources with deletion protection enabled (e.g., RDS instances, termination protection on EC2)
     - Check for resources that were created outside of CloudFormation but are referenced in the stack
     - Verify that S3 buckets are empty before deletion (CloudFormation won't delete non-empty buckets)
     - Check for dependencies from other stacks or resources outside the stack
     - Look for resources that might be in use by other services
     - Consider using `RetainResources` parameter to skip problematic resources
     - For nested stacks, try deleting child stacks first if the parent deletion fails
     - Check CloudTrail logs for specific deletion failure reasons

5. **Parameter and output issues:**
   - **Issue**: Parameters aren't correctly passed between stacks or outputs aren't available.
   - **Solutions**:
     - Verify parameter names match exactly between parent and nested stacks
     - Check that output values are correctly exported with unique names
     - Ensure imports use the exact export name with correct case sensitivity
     - Verify parameter types match the expected values
     - Check for parameter constraints that might be violated
     - Ensure outputs are defined before they're referenced in other stacks
     - For cross-stack references, verify stacks are in the same region and account

6. **Custom resource failures:**
   - **Issue**: Custom resources fail to create, update, or delete properly.
   - **Solutions**:
     - Check Lambda function logs for errors in custom resource handlers
     - Verify the Lambda execution role has necessary permissions
     - Ensure the custom resource sends proper responses to CloudFormation
     - Check for timeouts in Lambda functions (default 3 seconds may be too short)
     - Verify the S3 URLs for Lambda code are accessible
     - Check for errors in the custom resource logic
     - Ensure the Lambda function handles all required lifecycle events (Create, Update, Delete)
     - Verify network connectivity if the Lambda function needs to access other services

7. **Template size and complexity issues:**
   - **Issue**: Templates are too large or complex to deploy successfully.
   - **Solutions**:
     - Break large templates into nested stacks to stay under the 51,200 byte limit
     - Use S3 to store templates that exceed the size limit
     - Simplify complex templates by using nested stacks for logical grouping
     - Use parameters and mappings to reduce repetitive resource definitions
     - Consider using macros to simplify template authoring
     - Use AWS::Include transform for common patterns
     - Monitor deployment time and break up stacks that take too long to deploy

8. **Resource provisioning timeouts:**
   - **Issue**: Stack creation or update times out due to slow resource provisioning.
   - **Solutions**:
     - Check resource types that typically take longer to provision (RDS, ElastiCache, etc.)
     - Consider increasing service quotas if hitting limits
     - Break complex stacks into smaller stacks to reduce overall deployment time
     - Use nested stacks to parallelize resource creation where possible
     - Check for resource dependencies that might be creating bottlenecks
     - Monitor resource creation in the AWS Console for specific delays
     - Consider using DependsOn to optimize the creation order

### Log Analysis Guide

When troubleshooting CloudFormation issues, analyzing logs and events is essential:

1. **Stack Events Analysis**:
   - Review events in chronological order to trace the sequence of failures
   - Look for `CREATE_FAILED`, `UPDATE_FAILED`, or `DELETE_FAILED` status reasons
   - Note the specific resource that failed first, as it's often the root cause
   - Check for dependency failures that cascade to other resources
   - Pay attention to the status reason text for specific error messages
   - Common patterns:
     - `Resource creation cancelled` - Often indicates a dependency failure
     - `Property validation failure` - Incorrect property values or types
     - `Access denied` - IAM permission issues

2. **Resource-Specific Logs**:
   - For EC2 instances, check system logs and user data execution logs
   - For Lambda functions, check CloudWatch Logs for function execution
   - For custom resources, examine the Lambda function logs
   - For ECS services, check container logs and service events
   - For RDS instances, check database logs for initialization issues

3. **CloudTrail Analysis**:
   - Look for API calls made by CloudFormation service role
   - Check for permission denied errors in API responses
   - Identify throttling issues that might affect deployment
   - Verify resource creation and deletion API calls

4. **Drift Analysis**:
   - Examine which specific properties have drifted
   - Check if drift was caused by automated processes or manual changes
   - Look for patterns in drift across similar resources
   - Consider whether drift affects functionality or just configuration

When analyzing CloudFormation issues, consider:
- The hierarchical nature of nested stacks and resource dependencies
- Timing issues between dependent resources
- Service quotas and limits that might be reached
- Region-specific service availability
- IAM permission boundaries and resource policies
- External dependencies not managed by CloudFormation

## Resources Created

This lab creates the following AWS resources:

### Networking Resources
- **VPC**: Virtual Private Cloud with custom CIDR
- **Subnets**: Public and private subnets across availability zones
- **Internet Gateway**: For public internet access
- **Route Tables**: For controlling network traffic

### Security Resources
- **Security Groups**: For web tier and application tier
- **IAM Roles**: For Lambda functions and EC2 instances

### Compute Resources

- S3 Storage: ~$0.023/GB/month (minimal for templates)
- Lambda Function: Likely free tier eligible
- **Total estimated cost**: $0.50-$1.00/day (mostly for EC2 instances)

## Cleanup

When you're finished with the lab, follow these steps to avoid ongoing charges:

1. **Run the cleanup script:**
   ```bash
   # On Linux/Mac:
   ./scripts/cleanup-nested-stacks.sh
   
   # On Windows:
   bash scripts/cleanup-nested-stacks.sh
   ```

2. **Verify cleanup:**
   ```bash
   # Check if the parent stack was deleted
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name devops-lab-nested 2>&1 | grep -q "does not exist"
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then echo "Stack successfully deleted"; else echo "Stack may still exist"; fi
   
   # Check if the S3 bucket was deleted
   aws s3 ls s3://devops-lab-nested-templates-* 2>&1 | grep -q "NoSuchBucket"
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then echo "Bucket successfully deleted"; else echo "Bucket may still exist"; fi
   ```
   
   - Ensure all stacks are deleted
   - Verify S3 buckets are removed
   - Check that no EC2 instances remain running

> **Important**: Failure to delete resources may result in unexpected charges to your AWS account.

## Additional Troubleshooting Tips for CloudFormation

#### Common CloudFormation Error Messages and Solutions

1. **"Template format error: [SECTION] is invalid"**
   - **Solution**: Check YAML or JSON syntax in the specified section. Common issues include incorrect indentation, missing colons, or unbalanced brackets.

2. **"Resource handler returned message: 'X' is not authorized to perform: 'Y' on resource: 'Z'"**
   - **Solution**: The IAM role or user executing CloudFormation lacks necessary permissions. Add the required permissions to your IAM policy.

3. **"The following resource(s) failed to create: [RESOURCE]"**
   - **Solution**: Check the specific resource's events for detailed error messages. Often caused by invalid property values or resource-specific constraints.

4. **"Export with name X is already exported by stack Y"**
   - **Solution**: Use a different export name or remove the conflicting export from the other stack.

5. **"Security token included in the request is invalid"**
   - **Solution**: Your AWS credentials have expired or are invalid. Refresh your credentials or check your AWS CLI configuration.

#### Analyzing CloudFormation Logs

When analyzing CloudFormation logs for troubleshooting:

1. **Focus on the first failure**: CloudFormation typically fails in a cascade, with the first failure being the root cause.

2. **Look for specific error codes**: Error codes like `AccessDenied`, `ValidationError`, or `InsufficientCapabilities` provide clues to the issue.

3. **Check resource properties**: Many failures occur due to invalid property values or combinations.

4. **Examine IAM permissions**: Verify that CloudFormation has permissions to create all resources in your template.

5. **Check service quotas**: Some failures occur because you've reached service limits.

#### Advanced Debugging Techniques

1. **Incremental deployment**: Deploy resources in smaller groups to isolate issues.

2. **Use CloudFormation Guard**: Validate templates against policy rules before deployment.

3. **Enable CloudTrail**: Track API calls made by CloudFormation for deeper investigation.

4. **Use AWS Config**: Monitor resource configurations and detect drift.

5. **Create test templates**: Isolate problematic resources in minimal test templates.

#### CloudFormation Best Practices to Avoid Issues

1. **Use linting tools**: Validate template syntax before deployment.

2. **Implement proper error handling**: Use `DependsOn` attributes and `CreationPolicy` resources.

3. **Use parameter constraints**: Define `AllowedValues`, `MinLength`, `MaxLength`, etc.

4. **Implement proper IAM permissions**: Use least privilege principles.

5. **Use nested stacks effectively**: Break complex templates into manageable components.

6. **Implement proper deletion policies**: Use `DeletionPolicy` attributes to control resource retention.

7. **Use stack policies**: Protect critical resources from accidental updates.

8. **Implement proper tagging**: Tag resources for better organization and tracking.
